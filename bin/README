We need to manually check the new CLI against the old. The tools in the help
directory allow for this.

Once a mode has been checked, it should be removed from the list. Once all modes
have been checked, this directory can be removed.

To update, from the source tree

    PATH=$PWD/_build/macosx64/bin:$PATH python3 bin/help/infinit-help infinit --base=bin/help/revamp/

The trailing / is important.

And then, still from the source tree

    for i in bin/help/legacy/*
    do
      m=$(basename $i)
      pr -w160 -t -m $i bin/help/revamp/$m  > bin/help/diffs/$m
    done
