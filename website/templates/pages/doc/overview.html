    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>The Infinit technology allows for the creating for heterogeneous storage infrastructures by aggregating various storage resources and unifying them into a UNIX-like Infinit file system.</p> <br><br>

    <p>Infinit file systems benefit from several advantages over the centralized and distributed file systems commonly used. <a href="#">See the comparisons</a></p>

    <div class="features">
        <div>
          <h2>Secure</h2>
          <p>All the files stored are cut into chunk and every chunk is encrypted (RSA/AES-256) with a unique key.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>CONTROL</h2>
          <p>Control the localisation of your data by selecting the storage resources/providers involved in the infrastructure.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>FLEXIBLE</h2>
          <p>Manage your storage capacity needs as you go by adding/removing storages without interrupting the service.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>NATURAL</h2>
          <p>Access your files on any device, from anywhere at any time through a native file system interface.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>AFFORDABLE</h2>
          <p>No need to acquire specific hardware/appliance or setup/maintain a complicated server-side installation.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>SCALABLE</h2>
          <p>Every block of every file is dynamically replicated several times in order to ensure durability and availability of the data.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>HIGH PERFORMANCE</h2>
          <p>Benefit from a high-throughput UDP-based network protocol for faster data retrieval.</p>
        </div>

         <div>
          <h2>FAULT TOLERANT</h2>
          <p>Detects failures and automatically adapts the network to guarantee the reliability of the data.</p>
        </div>

         <div>
          <h2>ON-DEMAND</h2>
          <p>Access/stream the files on-demand without the need to store the files locally or download them before.</p>
        </div>

         <div>
          <h2>ACCESS CONTROL</h2>
          <p>Decide who can read/edit your files with fine-grain access control capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

         <div>
          <h2>VERSIONING</h2>
          <p>Browse through the different versions of a file.</p>
        </div>

         <div>
          <h2>MIGRATION</h2>
          <p>Easily migrate your data from one provider to another whenever you need without any service interruption.</p>
