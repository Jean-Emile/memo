    <h1>Reference</h1>

    <p class="note">Introduction where you explain what is the purpose of this section talking about the reference of Infinit file system code base.</p>

    <h2>Nomenclature</h2>

    <p>The Infinit command-line tools are composed of several binaries, each dealing with a specific resource.</p>

    <p>A <span class="code">user</span> is represented through his/her RSA key pair. The user can create a network that represents the interconnection of one or more computers, servers and cloud services. A <span class="code">storage</span> is a storage resource, local or remote, that can be connected to a network to support part of the overall storage load. Finally, a <span class="code">network</span> can welcome several <span class="code">volumes</span> i.e logical drives.</p>

    <p>The <span class="code">hub</span> is a cloud service whose role is to ease the process of discovery, sharing and more.</p>

    <h2>Home</h2>

    <p>All the configuration files Infinit creates and uses are located in the <span class="code">$INFINIT_HOME</span> directory which, by default, is set to <span class="code">$HOME/.infinit/</span>.</p>

    <p>One can very easily set the environment variable to point to the directory of your choice, either by modifying your shell configuration or by setting it manually:</p>

<pre><code>$> export INFINIT_HOME=”/some/where/”
$>
</code></pre>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>All the command-line tools rely on the same terminology when it comes to options and arguments. It should therefore be pretty straightforward to start using a new binary. For instance, all the binaries have <span class="code">--create</span>, <span class="code">--list</span>, <span class="code">--fetch</span> etc. options.</p>

    <p>For more information on the options provided by a binary, do not hesitate to rely on the <span class="code">--help</span> option. Noteworthy is that the help is relative to the options already provided. Therefore, do not hesitate to use the <span class="code">--help</span> option with other options.</p>

    <p>As an example, the help for infinit-user displays the general options available: export, create, import, register etc.:</p>

<pre><code>$> infinit-user --help
Usage: infinit-user MODE [OPTIONS...]

Infinit user utility:

Modes:
  --export               Export a user for someone else to import
  --create               Create a user
  --import               Import a user
  --register             Create and register a user

Miscellaneous:
  -h [ --help ]          display the help
  -s [ --script ]        silence all extraneous human friendly messages
  -v [ --version ]       display version
$>
</code></pre>

    <p>However, the help when invoking the <span class="code">--create</span> option gives another output:</p>

<pre><code>$> infinit-user --create --help
Usage: infinit-user --create [OPTIONS...]

Create a user:

Create options:
  -n [ --name ] arg      user name (defaults to system username)
  -k [ --key ] arg       RSA key pair in PEM format - e.g. your SSH key
                         (generated if unspecified)
$>
</code></pre>

    <h2>Hub</h2>

    <p>All entities created such as users, storages, networks, volumes etc. are created locally by default with no server involved. The creation process may generate one or more files and store them in the <span class="code">$INFINIT_HOME</span> directory.</p>

    <p>Only subsequently can a user decide to publish those entities to the hub. The Infinit hub is useful for users to easily retrieve their resources (credentials, networks, volumes etc.) on other devices.</p>

    <p>Also, through the hub, users will be able to invite other users through their name rather than by manipulating user files manually. Note that in the future, other functionalities will be added to further simplify the process through the hub.</p>

    <h2><a id="user">User</a></h2>

    <p>The <span class="code">infinit-user</span> binary allows you to create, export and import users among other actions. A user is not much more than a RSA key pair that will be used to sign and encrypt data.</p>

    <p>The following creates a user, generating a RSA key pair for you. Note that the name of the user is deduced from the system:</p>

<pre><code>$> echo $USER
chiche
$> infinit-user --create
Generating RSA keypair.
Generated user "chiche".
$>
</code></pre>

    <p>You can specify the name of the user through the <span class="code">--name</span> option:</p>

<pre><code>$> infinit-user --create --name chodaboy
Generating RSA keypair.
Generated user "chodaboy".
$>
</code></pre>

    <p>Likewise, if you want Infinit to use your SSH RSA key rather than generating a new one:</p>

<pre><code>
$> infinit-user --create --name chodaboy --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Passphrase:
Generated user "chodaboy".
$>
</code></pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Keep in mind that the user-related data must never fall into someone else’s hands. The user file is the equivalent of an SSH key file and must therefore be kept private at all times.</p>

    <p>You may want to export a user, to transfer it to another computer for instance. Even though Infinit provides a way to move resources around through the Infinit hub, such a functionality is not provided for users given their sensitive nature.</p>
