    <h1>Get Started</h1>

    <p class="note">The following is written for users of Mac OS X. If you are not using Mac OS X, please refer to the Linux and Windows guides.</p>

    <p class="note">Before proceeding, make sure you understand that this guide uses Infinit command­line tools with a terminal window. You don’t need to be a UNIX guru but you should be familiar with typing shell commands and interpreting outputs.</p>

    <h2>Download and install Infinit depedencies</h2>

    <p>Infinit relies on FUSE to create filesystems in userland. If not already, you will need install the OSX FUSE module by following the instructions:</p>

    <a class="button" href="#">Download OS X Fuse</a>

    <h2>Download and install the Infinit command-line tools</h2>

    <p>Please follow the link below to download the Infinit command ­line tools:</p>

    <a class="button" href="#">Download</a><br><br><br>

    <p>Next, open your terminal and extract the Infinit tarball:</p>

<pre><code>$> tar xjvf infinit­0.2.0.tbz
infinit­0.2.0/
infinit­0.2.0/bin/
infinit­0.2.0/lib
...
infinit­0.2.0/bin/infinit­storage
infinit­0.2.0/bin/infinit­user
infinit­0.2.0/bin/infinit­volume
$></code></pre>

    <p>All the configuration files the Infinit command­line tools create and use are located in the <span class="code">$INFINIT_HOME</span> directory which, by default, is set to <span class="code">$HOME/.infinit/</span>. You can change edit your shell configuration to set <span class="code">INFINIT_HOME</span> to another location if you want.</p>


    <p class="note">Note: We advise you to do so if you have the Infinit file transfer application on your computer as both applications would store their configuration files in <span class="code">$HOME/.infinit/</span>.</p>

    <p>Now that you’ve extracted the tarball, take a look. The extract directory contains subdirectories. <span class="code">bin/</span> contains the actual Infinit binaries such as infinit-user, infinit-network and more. The <span class="code">lib/</span> subdirectory contains all the libraries those binaries require to operate. Finally, the <span class="code">test/</span> subdirectory is provided for you to quickly test those command-line tools, see below.</p>


<pre><code>$> cd infinit-0.2.0/
$> ls
bin/  lib/  test/
$>
</code></pre>

    <h2>Test by mounting an existing volume</h2>

    <p>As a first test, you are going to mount an existing volume that accesses data blocks located in a network we created ourselves. Don’t worry, this volume only contains test files and you cannot do any harm to those files since the test users only has read-only access.</p>

    <p>Add the <span class="code">bin/</span> to the PATH environment variable to be able to invoke the command-line tools from anywhere:</p>

<pre><code>$> export PATH=$PWD/bin/:$PATH
$>
</code></pre>

    <p>Now run the infinit-volume command by prefixing it with the environment variable <span class="code">INFINIT_HOME=$PWD/../test/home</span> to tell the command where to look for the configuration files required for this test.</p>

<pre><code>$> INFINIT_HOME=$PWD/test/home/ infinit-volume --mount --name test --mountpoint $PWD/test/mountpoint/ -as alice
… XXX ...
$>
</code></pre>

    <p>This command mounts the volume named <span class="code">test</span> on behalf of the user ‘alice’ and makes it accessible from the mount point <span class="code">test/mountpoint/</span>.</p>

    <p>At this point, you can access the files in the <span class="code">test</span> volume by browsing the <span class="code">test/mountpoint/</span> directory.</p>

<pre><code>$> cd ../test/
$> ls
home/ mountpoint/
$> cd mountpoint/
$> ls
… XXX …
$>
</code></pre>

    <p>Noteworthy is that test <span class="code">test</span> volume contains 2GB of data. However, unlike cloud storage services like Dropbox, you were able to access its content without having to wait hours for all the files to be downloaded locally.</p>

    <p>Now you can use both the terminal and your desktop graphical environment to access the files in the mount point. Try it!</p>

    <h2>Set up your own storage infrastructure</h2>

    <p>Now that you know how to mount an existing volume, let’s move on to the next step: setting up your own storage infrastructure, being simply built on top of a single cloud-based storage resource or composed of dozens of computers, servers and clouds.</p>
