    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>The Infinit Storage Platform allows for the creation of scalable, resilient and secure storage infrastructure for modern and container environments.</p>

    <p>Infinit benefits from several advantages over the centralized and distributed systems commonly used.</p>

        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/control.png')}"> Control</h3>

        <div>
        <h2 id="secure">Secure</h2>
        <p>All the files stored are cut into chunk and every chunk is encrypted (RSA/AES-256) with a unique key.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 id="control">Control</h2>
        <p>Control the localisation of your data by selecting the storage resources/providers involved in the infrastructure.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 id="reliable">Reliable</h2>
        <p>Every block of every file is dynamically replicated several times (configurable by the administrator) in order to ensure durability and availability of the data.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 id="fault-tolerant">Fault Tolerant</h2>
        <p>Detects failures and automatically adapts the number of replicas in order to guarantee the reliability of the data.</p>
        </div>


        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/scalable.png')}"> Scalability</h3>

        <div>
        <h2 id="flexible">Flexible</h2>
        <p>Manage your needs in terms of storage capacity by increasing/decreasing (scale up/down) contributions from existing providers and/or adding/removing (scale out/in) storage resources without interrupting the service.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 id="scalable">Scalable</h2>
        <p>With a peer-to-peer foundation, Infinit does not suffer single points of failure or bottlenecks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="clear">
        <h2 id="high-performance">High Performance</h2>
        <p>Benefit from a high-throughput UDP-based network protocol for faster data retrieval.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 id="adaptability">Adaptability</h2>
        <p>In the event of a failure, the system heals itself by automatically adjusting the number of replicas.</p>
        </div>


        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/keyboard.png')}"> Administration</h3>

        <div>
        <h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>

        <div>
        <h2 id="access-control">Access Control</h2>
        <p>Decide who can read/edit files and folders through fine-grained access control capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 id="affordable">Affordable</h2>
        <p>No need to acquire specific hardware/appliance or setup/maintain a complicated server-side installation.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
        <p>Browse through the different versions of a file and rollback if necessary.</p>
        </div>


        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/infinit-cloud-apps.png')}"> Interface</h3>

        <div>
        <h2 id="natural">Natural</h2>
