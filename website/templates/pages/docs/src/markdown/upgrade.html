<p>This will guide you through setting up an Amazon S3 bucket as a storage resource for Infinit.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> account with administrator privileges.</li>
<li><a href="${route('doc_get_started')}">Infinit installed</a>.</li>
<li>An <a href="${route('doc_reference')}#user">Infinit user</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-an-s3-bucket">Creating an S3 bucket</h3>
<p>Start by navigating to <em>S3</em> in the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Management Console</a>. From here you click <em>Create Bucket</em>. As Amazon S3 buckets must be named uniquely across the entire platform, it's good practice to use your domain name and optionally the region the bucket is hosted in the name.</p>
<p><img src="${url('images/docs/s3/create-bucket.png')}" alt="AWS Management Console create bucket popup"></p>
<p>Make a note of the bucket name and region that you chose as you will need this later.</p>
<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Choose your bucket region to be closest to where you will be using it from. This will ensure that you have higher transfer speeds and lower latency when accessing your Infinit volume.</em></p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-aws-user">Creating a new AWS user</h3>
<p>We will now create a new AWS user which only has access to the bucket we created. We do this to improve the security of the system as in the unlikely event that the credentials are stolen, the thief will only have limited access to your AWS account.</p>
<p>Navigate back to the root of the AWS Management Console and then to <em>Identity &amp; Access Management</em>. Before creating the new user, we will create a custom <em>policy</em> which describes what the user is allowed to access. Click <em>Policies</em> on the left panel, then <em>Get Started</em>, then <em>Create Policy</em> and finally <em>Create Your Own Policy</em>.</p>
<p>The policy below will allow any S3 operation to be performed on the <code>infinit-s3-storage-de-example-com</code> bucket.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::infinit-s3-storage-de-example-com",
          "arn:aws:s3:::infinit-s3-storage-de-example-com/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="${url('images/docs/s3/create-policy.png')}" alt="AWS Management Console create user policy"></p>
<p>Once the policy has been created, you are ready to create the new user. Navigate to <em>Users</em> on the left panel and click <em>Create New Users</em>. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Once you've created the user, ensure that you download the user's credentials as you will need these later.</p>
<p><img src="${url('images/docs/s3/create-user.png')}" alt="AWS Management Console create user"></p>
<p>From the <em>Users</em> view, click on the name of the user that you created, select <em>Permissions</em> and attach the policy that you created for the user.</p>
<p><img src="${url('images/docs/s3/attach-policy.png')}" alt="AWS Management Console attach policy to user"></p>
<h3 id="add-aws-credentials-to-infinit">Add AWS credentials to Infinit</h3>
<p>Now that the AWS user has been created with the correct policy attached, we can add the user's credentials to Infinit. These credentials are the ones that you downloaded when <a href="#creating-a-new-aws-user">creating the user</a>.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-credentials --add --as alice --aws --name s3-user
Please enter your AWS credentials
Access Key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
Secret Access Key: ****************************************
Locally stored AWS credentials "s3-user".
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: AWS credentials are only ever stored locally and cannot be pushed to the Hub.</em></p>
<h3 id="creating-the-infinit-storage-resource">Creating the Infinit storage resource</h3>
<p>With the AWS user's credentials added to Infinit, you can now create the storage resource.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a name to the storage resource, you will need to include the bucket name and bucket region. Be careful because the bucket region is not the literal name (Frankfurt) of the region but it's identifier (eu-central-1). Refer to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region">AWS's documentation</a> to find out your region's identifier.</p>
<p>Finally, you will need to specify the name of the credentials you recently registered, <em>s3-user</em> in this example, through the <code>--account</code> option. The <code>--path</code> option indicates the name of the folder, within the bucket, that will be used to hold the encrypted data blocks stored by Infinit.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-storage --create --s3 --name s3-storage --account s3-user --region eu-central-1 --bucket infinit-s3-storage-de-example-com --path blocks-folder
Create storage "s3-storage".
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can optionally use Amazon S3's reduced redundancy storage by passing the <code>--reduced-redundancy</code> flag on creation of the storage resource.</em></p>
