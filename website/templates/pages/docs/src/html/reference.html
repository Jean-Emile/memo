<h1 id="reference">Reference</h1>
<p>This document goes through the command-line tools, describing how to perform specific tasks such as creating a storage network, contributing storage capacity, inviting users to join a drive and more.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>The Infinit command-line tools are composed of several binaries, each dealing with a specific resource/object.</p>
<p>A <em>user</em> represents the entity performing operations on files, directly or indirectly. Every user possesses a RSA key pair that is used to identify him/her. A user can create a <em>network</em> which represents the interconnection of computing devices that will compose the storage infrastructure. A <em>storage</em> is a storage resource, local or remote, that can be connected to a device to support part of the overall storage load. Finally, several <em>volume</em>s --- i.e logical drives ---  can be created within a network.</p>
<p>The <em>hub</em> is a cloud service whose role is to ease the process of discovery, sharing and more.</p>
<h3 id="home">Home</h3>
<p>All the configuration files Infinit creates and uses are located in the <code>$INFINIT_HOME</code> directory which, by default, is set to <code>$HOME/.local/share/infinit/filesystem/</code>.</p>
<p>One can very easily set the environment variable to point to the directory of his/her choice, either by modifying your shell configuration or by setting it manually:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; export INFINIT_HOME="/some/where/"
</code></pre><h3 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h3>
<p>All the command-line tools rely on the same terminology when it comes to options and arguments. As an example, most binaries have options named <code>--create</code>, <code>--list</code>, <code>--fetch</code> etc.</p>
<p>For more information on the options provided by a binary, do not hesitate to rely on the <code>--help</code> option. Noteworthy is that the help is relative to the options already provided. Therefore, do not hesitate to use the <code>--help</code> option with other options.</p>
<p>As an example, the help for <em>infinit-user</em> displays the general options available: export, create, import, register etc.:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; Usage: ./infinit-user MODE [OPTIONS...]

Infinit user utility:

Modes:
  --create               Create a user
  --export               Export a user so that it may be imported elsewhere
  --fetch                Fetch a user from the Hub
  --import               Import a user
  --pull                 Remove a user from the Hub
  --delete               Delete a user locally
  --push                 Push a user to the Hub
  --signup               Create and register a user
  --login                Log the user to the Hub
  --list                 List users

Miscellaneous:
  -h [ --help ]          display the help
  -s [ --script ]        silence all extraneous human friendly messages
  -v [ --version ]       display version
</code></pre><p>However, the help when invoking the <code>--create</code> option gives another output:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; Usage: ./infinit-user --create [OPTIONS...]

Create a user:

Create options:
  -n [ --name ] arg      user name (default: system user)
  -k [ --key ] arg       RSA key pair in PEM format - e.g. your SSH key
                         (default: generate key pair)
  --push-user            push the user to the Hub
  -p [ --push ]          alias for --push-user
  --email arg            valid email address (mandatory when using --push-user)
  --fullname arg         user fullname (optional)
  --full                 include private key in order to facilitate device
                         pairing and fetching lost keys.
  --password-inline arg  password to authenticate with the Hub. Used with
                         --full (default: prompt for password)
</code></pre><p>Every binary follows the same semantic with the first option representing the mode of operation (a verb): <code>--create</code>, <code>--pull</code>, <code>--list</code>, <code>--delete</code>, <code>--export</code> etc.</p>
<p>The name/identifier of the object on which you which to operate can be specified through the <code>--name</code> option or simply by providing it outside of any option. As such both lines below are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-volume --push --name personal
$&gt; infinit-volume --push personal
</code></pre><p>Except for the <em>infinit-user</em> binary, one can specify the Infinit user behind the action by relying on the <code>--as</code> option followed by the user name. If not specified, the <code>$INFINIT_USER</code> environment variable will be used, unless it is not set in which case the system user name is used.</p>
<p>Finally, some command-line tools, in particular <em>infinit-network</em>, and <em>infinit-volume</em> can be “run”. As such, they have options such as <code>--start</code>, <code>--stop</code>, <code>--status</code> etc. in order to allow developers to manipulate them in a similar fashion to other UNIX daemons e.g init scripts.</p>
<h3 id="hub">Hub</h3>
<p>All objects (users, storages, networks, volumes etc.) are created locally by default with no server involved. The creation process may generate one or more files and store them in the <code>$INFINIT_HOME</code> directory.</p>
<p>The command-line tools however provide a way to rely on the hub for certain operations in order to simplify some administrative tasks such as inviting a user to a drive, sharing the volumes created within a network, moving the user identity to another of your devices and so on. In addition, some functionalities such as the consumption of storage capacity in a network are only available through the hub. As a rule of thumb, we advise you to always rely on the hub, unless you know exactly what you are doing.</p>
<p>The use of the hub can be activated through specific options, mostly <code>--push</code>, <code>--fetch</code> and <code>--pull</code>. The <code>--push</code> option publishes an object on the hub for other users to retrieve it. The <code>--pull</code> option does the exact opposite, removing the object (and its sub-objects) from the hub. Finally, the <code>--fetch</code> option retrieves a resource from the hub, e.g a network descriptor, and stores it locally in the <code>$INFINIT_HOME</code> directory.</p>
<p>One can decide to either create objects locally before pushing them to the hub or to perform both tasks through a single action by specifying the hub option (<code>--push</code> for instance) when invoking the command-line tool.</p>
<p>Note that some binaries operate in hub mode only because of their purpose is hub specific. For instance the <em>infinit-drive</em> binary would not make sense without the hub since its role is to bridge the gap between a low-level storage infrastructure and potential non-tech-savvy users.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This document covers mainly flows involving the hub. For users wanting to use Infinit in a pure decentralized environment, just know that <code>--push</code>/<code>--fetch</code> operations must be replaced by manual <code>--export</code>/<code>--import</code> operations while the files must be manually shared with other users and moved between devices. Also, you will sometimes need to provide additional information such as the IP address of bootstrap nodes in order to discover the other nodes of a network.</p>
<h2 id="user">User</h2>
<p>The <em>infinit-user</em> binary allows one to create a user identity, publish it on the hub to be referenced by other users, transmit it to another device and so on and so forth.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-user">Create a user</h3>
<p>A user is not much more than a RSA key pair that will be used to sign and encrypt data. The following creates a user, automatically generating a new RSA key pair.</p>
<p>Note that the name of the user is deduced from the system if you do not specify a name through the <code>--name</code> option or the <code>$INFINIT_USER</code> environment variable.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; echo $USER
alice
$&gt; infinit-user --create
Generating RSA keypair.
Locally generated user “alice”.
</code></pre><p>You may want to specify the RSA keypair to use rather than generating a new one. You can use the <code>--key</code> option to reference your SSH RSA key and Infinit will create a user identity based on it.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-user --create --name alice --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Passphrase: ********
Locally generated user “alice”.
</code></pre><p><em><strong>WARNING</strong>: Keep in mind that your Infinit user identity must never fall into someone else’s hands. The user identity file is the equivalent of an SSH key file and must therefore be kept private at all times.</em></p>
<h3 id="sign-up-on-the-hub">Sign up on the hub</h3>
<p>To register on the hub, you can either use the <code>--push</code> option when creating your user, push the user once it has been created locally or register directly on the hub.</p>
<p>To push an existing user, simply invoke the <em>infinit-user</em> with the <code>--push</code> mode and <code>--email</code> option to specify a valid email address. Needless to say that this email address will <em>never</em> be shared with third parties and will solely be used for Infinit to communicate news of the file storage platform.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Given the critical nature of the user identity, we strongly advise you to read the <a href="#log-in-on-another-device">Log in on another device</a> section in order to completely understand the ramifications of the options used when pushing your user.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-user --push --name alice --fullname “Alice” --email alice@company.com
Remotely pushed user “alice”.
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, since names are unique, your user name may already be taken on the hub, in which case the operation will fail. The action <code>--signup</code> has been introduced to overcome this problem, performing the equivalent of <code>--create --push</code> atomically, making sure that the user is created locally and remotely at once.</p>
<p>In order to avoid complications, we advise users to sign up to the hub. Proceed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-user --signup --name alice --fullname “Alice” --email alice@company.com
Generating RSA keypair.
Remotely pushed user “alice”.
</code></pre><h2 id="credentials">Credentials</h2>
<p>The <em>infinit-credentials</em> binary manages the credentials to your cloud services. Indeed, cloud services can be added to be later plugged to a network as storage resources.</p>
<p>The cloud services can be of very different nature, being storage service at the block level such as AWS S3 object store service, at the file level such as Dropbox or Google Drive, even services that store data item of a specific nature such as images with Flickr. Basically anything that allows writing, editing, finding and deleting a piece of information.</p>
<p>Infinit considers these cloud services as basic and unprivileged datastores that are used to store blocks of encrypted data.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: Because this binary exclusively works with the hub, you must have registered your user to the Infinit hub to be able to manage your credentials. For more information, please refer to the <a href=”#user”>User</a> section, more specifically how to <a href=”#sign-up-on-the-hub”>Sign up on the hub</a>.</em></p>
<h3 id="add-credentials">Add credentials</h3>
<p>To add a cloud service such as Dropbox, just use the <code>--add</code> action option. Note however that depending on the cloud service to add, the options may vary along with the authentication process. Please refer to the help for more specific information.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-credentials --add --as alice --dropbox
Register your Dropbox account with Infinit by visiting https://…
$&gt;
</code></pre><p>Just follow the instructions by visiting the URL provided in order to authenticate yourself and authorize Infinit to access your account. At this point, you should be automatically redirect to the infinit.sh website:</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do not worry, Infinit will never alter the existing data items stored through a cloud service such as Dropbox; it will only create blocks of encrypted data in a subfolder specific to Infinit.</em></p>
<p>Once a cloud service added to your account, you can fetch those credentials on your device through the <code>--fetch</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-credentials --fetch --as alice
Fetched Dropbox credentials 51218344 (Alice)
Fetched AWS S3 credentials alice@company.com (Alice)
</code></pre><h3 id="list-credentials">List credentials</h3>
<p>At any point, you can list your local credentials through the <code>--list</code> option. Note that you may need to update the local credentials by fetching the latest ones from the hub:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-credentials --fetch --as alice
$&gt; infinit-credentials --list
Dropbox:
  51218344 (Alice)
AWS S3:
  alice@company.com (Alice)
</code></pre><h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>The <em>infinit-storage</em> binary allows for the definition of storage resources. Such storage resources can be local --- storing blocks of data on the local file system, on a partition or in a database --- or remote in which case the blocks of data are stored through a cloud service API.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-storage-resource">Create a storage resource</h3>
<h4 id="locally">Locally</h4>
<p>To create a storage resource on top of a local file system, simply specify the <code>--filesystem</code> option. Note that you can also specify, through the <code>--path</code> option, where the encrypted data blocks will be stored.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-storage --create --filesystem --capacity 2GB --name local
Created storage “local”.
</code></pre><p>Likewise, you can create a storage on top of a cloud service API. Obviously, you will need to add this cloud service through the <em>infinit-credentials</em> first, as shown in the <a href=”#add-credentials”>Add credentials</a> section.</p>
<p>All you need to do is specify the type of cloud service you want your storage to rely upon along with the cloud service account identifier. You can find this cloud service identifier when <a href=”#list-credentials”>listing your credentials</a>.</p>
<h4 id="remotely">Remotely</h4>
<p>The following creates a storage resource on top of Dropbox, specifying the account identifier and the name of your choice:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-storage --create --dropbox --account 51218344 --name dropbox
Created storage “dropbox”.
</code></pre><h3 id="list-storage-resources">List storage resources</h3>
<p>As with other binaries, you can list the storage resource you’ve created on this device through the <code>--list</code> action option:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-storage --list
local
dropbox
</code></pre><h3 id="delete-a-storage-resource">Delete a storage resource</h3>
<p>One can delete a storage resource through the <code>--delete</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-storage --delete --name local
</code></pre><p>Note however that, so far, should a network be using this storage resource, it will continue to do so.</p>
<h2 id="network">Network</h2>
<p>Through the <em>infinit-network</em> you are going to be able to create overlay networks, configure the the way the distributed hash table behaves and much more.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-network">Create a network</h3>
<p>The example below creates a network named ‘cluster’ which aggregates the storage resources controlled by the user involved in this network.</p>
<p>The network can be configured depending on your need as the storage infrastructure administrator. For instance, the number of computing devices could be extremely small, the owners of those computers could be somewhat untrustworthy and/or the machines could be expected to be turned off and on on a daily basis following their work schedule. All these parameters can be used to tune the network: the overlay’s topology, the replication factor, the fault tolerance algorithms and much more.</p>
<p>The following creates a small storage network, relying on the Kelips overlay network with a replication factor of 3. When creating a network, the user can decide to contribute storage resources:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-network --create --as alice --kelips --replication-factor 3 --storage local --storage dropbox --name cluster
Locally created network "alice/cluster".
</code></pre><h3 id="publish-a-network">Publish a network</h3>
<p>You can now publish a network for other users to fetch it. Note that the easiest way is always to append the <code>--push</code> option to the network creation command to perform both creation and publications actions at once.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can push the network to the hub through the <code>--push</code> action option, as usual:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-network --push --as alice --name cluster
Remotely pushed network "alice/cluster”.
</code></pre><p>As for every resource other resource, you can decide manipulate networks without relying on the hub. Please refer to the <code>--export</code> and <code>--import</code> options in this case.</p>
<h3 id="list-the-networks">List the networks</h3>
<p>You can easily list the networks that you have locally through the <code>--list</code> mode. Do not forget that you can always synchronize with the hub by fetching your networks:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-network --fetch --as alice
Fetched networks for user "alice".
$&gt; infinit-network --list
alice/cluster
</code></pre><h3 id="join-a-network">Join a network</h3>
<p>You may have <a href=”#receive-a-passport”>received</a>, through the hub or not, an invitation to join a network created by someone else. Such invitations are called <em>passports</em> and allow users to connect to the other devices of the network, contribute storage resources as well as request data blocks from the other nodes.</p>
<p>Once the passport in hand i.e in your <code>$INFINIT_HOME</code> directory, you must, <strong>for every device</strong>, join the network as shown below. However, in order to join such a network you must first retrieve its descriptor, from the hub for instance.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-network --fetch --as bob --name alice/cluster
Fetched network “alice/cluster”.
</code></pre><p>Now that you have locally both the network descriptor and the passport allowing you to join, it is time to actually join the network.</p>
<p>When joining a network, you can define which storage resources to contribute. In the example below, Bob is going to join Alice’s network named ‘cluster’ and contribute its storage resource named ‘nas’.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-network --join --as bob --name alice/cluster --storage nas
Locally joined network "alice/cluster”.
</code></pre><h2 id="passport">Passport</h2>
<p>The <em>infinit-passport</em> binary allows a user to allow other users to join one of his/her networks, allowing those users to connect devices, contribute storage resources and potentially access files in volumes.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-passport">Create a passport</h3>
<p>In order to allow another user to join a network, you must issue a passport. In order to reference the user to invite, you need to obtain his/her user public identity.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you want to invite the user ‘bob’ to your network. First you need to fetch his identity from the hub (or retrieve it manually if operating without the hub, see <code>--export</code> and <code>--import</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-user --fetch --as alice --name bob
Fetched user “bob”.
</code></pre><p>The passport that you are about to create will be sealed, allowing only Bob to connect new devices to the network:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-passport --create --as alice --network cluster --user bob
Locally created passport “alice/cluster: bob”.
</code></pre><p>Now that the passport has been created, read the <a href=”#distribute-a-passport>Distribute a passport</a> section to learn how to distribute it to the invited user.</p>
<h3 id="list-the-passports">List the passports</h3>
<p>You can list both the passports you’ve created for other users to join your networks and the passports issued by other users for you to join their networks:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-passport --list --as alice
alice/cluster: bob
</code></pre><h3 id="distribute-a-passport">Distribute a passport</h3>
<p>Once the passport locally created, you must distribute it to the invited user for him/her to be able to join the network.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do that is to rely on the hub, by appending the <code>--push</code> option when creating the passport; see the <a href=”#create-a-passport”>Create a passport</a> section.</p>
<p>You can otherwise push a local passport by invoking the <code>--push</code> action option as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-passport --push --as alice --network cluster --user bob
Remotely pushed passport “alice/cluster: bob”.
</code></pre><p>Should you be evolving in a pure decentralized environment i.e without the hub, you will need to manually export the passport and transmit it to the invited user.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware that the invited user will not be notified of that fact that you’ve allowed him/her to join your network. The invited user could detect it by fetching his passport and noticing a new one but that’s about it. In order to speed things up, you should probably tell him through the medium of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="receive-a-passport">Receive a passport</h3>
<p>You can very easily fetch your passports from the hub in order to refresh the local snapshot of your passports.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-passport --fetch --as bob
Fetched passports for user “bob”
$&gt; infinit-passport --list --as bob
alice/cluster: bob
</code></pre><p>_<strong>NOTE</strong>: The <em>infinit-passport</em> binary provides options to specifically fetch passports from a certain user or for a specific network._</p>
<p>That’s it, with new passports locally, you will be able to <a href=”#join-a-network”>join the networks</a> they allow you to connect to.</p>
<h2 id="volume">Volume</h2>
<p>On top of the storage layer i.e the network, one can create a file system also known as logical drive or volume. A volume is represented by the address of its root directory. While centralized file system store this address in a specific block known as the <em>superblock</em>, Infinit simply stores it in a file located in the <code>$INFINIT_HOME</code> directory which describes the volume.</p>
<p>Note that several volumes can be created within the same network, in which case you could see those as partitions on the same hard disk drive.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-volume">Create a volume</h3>
<p>The command below creates a volume in the network ‘cluster’. You can specify the default mount point with the option <code>--mountpoint</code> even though the following examples does not:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-volume --create --as alice --network cluster --name shared
Locally created volume “alice/shared”.
</code></pre><p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: You may have noticed that the name of the network is sometimes prepended with the username of its owner e.g alice/cluster. This fully qualified name helps distinguish objects that you own from the ones that you don’t. However, in most cases, you will not have to specify the fully-qualified name as the command-line tools are smart enough to deduce the object you are trying to reference.</em></p>
<h3 id="publish-a-volume">Publish a volume</h3>
<p>A volume often needs to be shared with the other users in the network. As for the other resources, the easiest way to perform this action is to rely on the hub, either by using the <code>--push</code> option at the volume creation or by publishing the volume as a separate action:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-volume --push --as alice --name shared
Remotely pushed volume “alice/shared”.
</code></pre><p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: You may however want to keep your volume private in a network to which several users contribute, in which case you can omit this step.</em></p>
<h3 id="list-the-volumes">List the volumes</h3>
<p>You can very easily list the volumes that you have locally through the <code>--list</code> mode. Remember that you can also fetch the volumes of your networks and the ones you’ve been invited to:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-volume --fetch --as alice
Fetched volumes for user “alice”.
$&gt; infinit-volume --list
alice/shared: network alice/cluster
</code></pre><h3 id="mount-a-volume">Mount a volume</h3>
<p>Mounting an Infinit volume is very similar to mounting any other file system. As usual, there are two ways to achieve this, either by relying on the hub as a helper or to do it manually in which case you will need to specify the host and port of some bootstrap nodes for your device to discover the nodes in the network.</p>
<p>Note that if you have been invited to join the network, you will need to fetch the volume before being able to mount it. Refer to the <a href=”#list-the-volumes”>List the volumes</a> section in this case.</p>
<p>The following command mounts an Infinit file system, connecting to the underlying network. Note that the <code>--publish</code> option tells the command-line to rely on the hub to ease the process of connecting to the network by providing you with the endpoint of bootstrap nodes while publishing your own endpoint in order to help other nodes discover this device as well:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-volume --mount --as alice --name shared --mountpoint /mnt/shared/ --publish
Fetched endpoints for “alice/cluster”.
Running network "alice/cluster”.
Remotely pushed endpoints for "alice/cluster”.
Running volume "alice/shared”.
...
</code></pre><p>Obviously, the mount point directory must exist for the volume to be mounted but this option can be omitted altogether should a default mount point had been provided at the volume creation.</p>
<p>_<strong>NOTE</strong>: There are a number of options that can be used to alter the behavior of the file system such as determining the size of the cache, activating asynchronous operations for better performance and many more.*</p>
<p>At this point, one can interact with the file system through common UNIX binaries as for any other file system:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; ls /mnt/shared/
$&gt; echo “everything is” &gt; /mnt/shared/awesome.txt
$&gt; cat /mnt/shared/awesome.txt
everything is
</code></pre><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Should you have recently joined this network, it is possible that the volume owner didn’t grant you access to the root directory, in which case you should get a “Permission Denied” error when listing the mount point. In this case, request the volume owner to <a href=”#grant-revoke-access”>grant you access</a>.</p>
<h2 id="access-control-list">Access Control List</h2>
<p>Having been invited to a network and volume does not necessarily mean that you will have the permission to browse the files and directories in it. As in most file system, in order to access, edit and even delete a file, its owner must first grant you the permission to do so.</p>
<p>Unlike many file systems, Infinit provides advanced decentralized (does not rely on the Hub) access control mechanisms that allows any user to manage permissions on his/her files and directories.</p>
<p>Note that being the owner of a volume automatically grants you access to it. It is then your responsibility to manage the permissions on the root directory and its subdirectories for other users to use the volume.</p>
<h3 id="grant-revoke-access">Grant/revoke access</h3>
<p>In order to grant or revoke access to a file or directory, one simply has to rely on the <em>infinit-acl</em> binary, providing the path to the object to manage and the permissions to apply.</p>
<p>The following grants Bob the permission to read and write the root directory of Alice’s volume named ‘shared’. Note that the <em>infinit-acl</em> binary provides many additional options that you may want to check out.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-acl --set --path /mnt/shared/ --mode rw --user bob
</code></pre><p>From that point, Bob, on his computer, will be able to access the volume to read and write files and directories.</p>
<h3 id="list-permissions">List permissions</h3>
<p>Every user with the volume descriptor can very easily list the permissions on any file system object:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-acl --list --path /mnt/shared/awesome.txt
/mnt/shared/awesome.txt:
     alice: rw
     bob: r
</code></pre><h2 id="device">Device</h2>
<h3 id="log-in-on-another-device">Log in on another device</h3>
<p>You may want to access your file systems from another machine. Even though it sounds easy, the critical and private nature of the user’s identity, similar to a SSH key, makes it a bit more complicated that all the other operations.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, one needs to re-create its Infinit environment with all the resources (users, networks, volumes, drives etc.) on the other computer. If you are already using Infinit in a completely decentralized manner, then the operation of exporting all the objects manually and re-importing them on the other device should not frighten you. If you have gotten used to the ease of use of the hub, then we offer you two possibilities to transmit your user identity on another device.</p>
<h4 id="keep-the-user-identity">Keep the user identity</h4>
<p>The easiest way, but less secure, way to retrieve your user identity on another device is to activate a mode in which your identity will be kept on the hub, encrypted with a key to protect it from potential intruders.</p>
<p>To activate this mode, you need to specify the <code>--full</code> option when signing up on the hub, along with a password, as shown below. Note that the password can be provided through the <code>--password</code> option or entered when prompted:</p>
<pre>
<div><span>Device A</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-user --signup --name alice --email alice@company.com --fullname Alice --full
Password: ********
Remotely pushed user “alice”.
</code>
</pre>

<p>Following this operation, one can login on another device very simply by invoking the following command:</p>
<pre class="alternate">
<div><span>Device B</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-user --login --name alice
Password: ********
Locally saved user “alice”.
</code>
</pre>

<p>That’s it, you can see by listing the local user that your private user identity has been retrieved:</p>
<pre class="alternate">
<div><span>Device B</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-user --list
alice: public/private keys
</code>
</pre>

<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you already registered your user on the hub but would like to activate this login mode, you can remove your user from the hub through the <code>--pull</code> option and then re-<code>--push</code> it taking care to provide the <code>--full</code> option along with a password.</em></p>
<h4 id="transmit-user-identity-to-another-device">Transmit user identity to another device</h4>
<p>If you are uncomfortable with us keeping your user identity (we are!), there is another way for you to just transmit your user identity to another machine.</p>
<p>Just know that for now, the method does rely on the hub as a temporary place for your user identity to be kept until it is retrieved on another device. If not retrieved after 5 minutes, it will be destroyed. In any case, your user identity is encrypted with a key of your choice so we cannot access it. In the future, a direct point-to-point method will be used to bypass the hub altogether.</p>
<pre>
<div><span>Device A</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-device --transmit --as alice --user
Password: ********
Transmitted user identity for “alice”.
</code>
</pre>

<p>From that point, you have 5 minutes to retrieve the user identity on another device through the following command:</p>
<pre class="alternate">
<div><span>Device B</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-device --receive --user --name alice
Password: ********
Received user identity for “alice”.
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can verify that the user has been saved locally by listing the local users:</p>
<pre class="alternate">
<div><span>Device B</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-user --list
alice: public/private keys
</code>
</pre>

<p>Once retrieved, the user identity is wiped out from the hub to make sure nobody can try anything. Even though this method is not ideal yet, it is a fair compromise between security (short window of attack, encrypted with a unique key of your choosing etc.) and simplicity (two commands to invoke, no file to manually move around etc.).</p>
<h4 id="manually-export-import-the-user-identity">Manually export/import the user identity</h4>
<p>For users that either do not trust any of the two methods above or want to evolve in a completely decentralized environment, there is another method which consists in exporting, moving a file manually to then re-importing the user identity on the new device.</p>
<p>First, export the user identity to have it in a file:</p>
<pre>
<div><span>Device A</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-user --export --name alice --full --output alice.user
WARNING: you are exporting the user "alice" including the private key
WARNING: anyone in possession of this information can impersonate that user
WARNING: if you mean to export your user for someone else, remove the --full flag
Exported user “alice”.
$> cat alice.user
{"email":"alice@company.com","fullname":"Alice","id":"2J8reEAY","name":"alice","private_key":{"rsa":"MIIEp...M/w=="},"public_key":{"rsa":"MIIBC...DAQAB"}}
</code>
</pre>

<p>At this point, it is your responsibility to move the file to your other device, through <em>SCP</em> for instance. Then, re-creating the user entity is then just one step away:</p>
<pre class="alternate">
<div><span>Device B</span></div>
<code>$> infinit-user --import --input alice.user
Imported user "alice".
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="drive">Drive</h2>
<p>Once you’ve created for storage infrastructure with a user, a network, storage resources and volumes, it may be time to invite other users, potentially non-tech-savvy, to use it to seamlessly store and access their files.</p>
<p>A client application called <em>‘Infinit Drive’</em> is provided for end-users to see the volumes they are allowed to access, the permissions etc.</p>
<p><img src="${url('images/desktop-client.png')}" alt="Infinit Drive app"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the notion of storage resource, networks and volumes is too technical for them to understand. Likewise, such users would probably like to receive a nice email explaining them how to set up and have things simplified for them.</p>
<p>This is why the notion of drive has been introduced. A drive is nothing more than an abstraction on top of a network/volume couple.</p>
<p>Rather than listing the networks and volumes a user is allowed to access in the graphical interface, only the drives will be shown. This way, should an administrator create a storage network with hundreds of volumes and a single one being abstracted as a drive, the end-user will only see this drive, making his/her experience as enjoyable as possible without limiting the possibilities of the underlying command-line tools.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-drive">Create a drive</h3>
<p>Creating a drive is as easy as any other operation. The following creates a drive named “workspace” based on the network “cluster” and volume “shared”.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-drive --create --as alice --network cluster --volume shared --name workspace --description “Alice’s, Bob’s and Charlie’s workspace” --push
Locally created drive “alice/workspace”.
Remotely pushed drive “alice/workspace”.
</code></pre><p>Note that the <code>--push</code> option is provided to publish it to the hub, making it retrievable by the other users, in particular the ones that we will be <a href=”#invite-users”>inviting</a> to join.</p>
<h3 id="list-the-drives">List the drives</h3>
<p>As for the other resources, one can very simply list the local drives. Note that refreshing the local snapshots can be achieved through the <code>--fetch</code> action:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-drive --fetch --as alice
Fetched drives for user “alice”.
$&gt; infinit-drive --list
alice/workspace
</code></pre><h3 id="invite-users">Invite users</h3>
<p>It is now time to invite non-tech-savvy users to join the drive you’ve created for them.</p>
<p>Note that before you can reference a user, you need to fetch his/her public identity through the <code>infinit-user --fetch</code> command line. Likewise, every user to invite must have been issued a passport to connect to the network.</p>
<p>The sequence of commands below shows how to invite both Bob and Charlie. However it is assumed that Bob has already been issued a passport while Charlie is a completely new user.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-user --fetch --as alice --name charlie
Fetched user “charlie”.
$&gt; infinit-passport --create --as alice --user charlie --network cluster --push
Locally created passport "alice/cluster: charlie".
Remotely pushed passport "alice/cluster: charlie".
$&gt; infinit-drive --invite --as alice --name workspace --user bob --user charlie --push
Locally created invitations “alice/workspace”.
Remotely pushed invitations "alice/workspace".
</code></pre><p>That’s it, Bob and Charlie have been invited to join the drive named “workspace”. Following the <code>--push</code> of the invitations, an email will have been sent to notify them of such an invitation, letting them know how to proceed from here.</p>
<h3 id="join-a-drive">Join a drive</h3>
<p>Even though the drive abstraction has been solely introduced for users of the graphical interface, you can decide to join a drive through the command-line tools.</p>
<p>First, think about refreshing your local snapshot by fetching the drives you’ve been invited to and already have access to. You can then list the drives you have locally.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-drive --fetch --as charlie
Fetched drive for user “charlie”
$&gt; infinit-drive --list --as charlie
alice/workspace
</code></pre><p>Finally, you can join a drive through the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; infinit-drive --join --as charlie --name alice/workspace
Remotely pushed invitation “alice/workspace”.
</code></pre><p>That’s it, you are now allowed to mount the volume associated with the drive to browse, store and access files. Note that you could have done that without going through the drive invitation process because you are using the command-line tools. Non-tech-savvy users however will appreciate having an interface clean of all everything but the drives they have been invited to join.</p>
