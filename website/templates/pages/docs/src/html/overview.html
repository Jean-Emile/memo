<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The Infinit technology allows for the creating for heterogeneous storage infrastructures by aggregating various storage resources and unifying them into a UNIX-like Infinit file system.</p>
<p><img src="${url('images/schema-global.png')}" alt="Schema of Infinit"><br></p>
<p>Infinit file systems benefit from several advantages over the <a href="${route('doc_comparisons')}">centralized and distributed file systems</a> commonly used.</p>
<div class="features">
<div>
<h2>Secure</h2>
<p>All the files stored are cut into chunk and every chunk is encrypted (RSA/AES-256) with a unique key.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Control</h2>
<p>Control the localisation of your data by selecting the storage resources/providers involved in the infrastructure.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Flexible</h2>
<p>Manage your elastic storage capacity needs as you go by adding/removing storages without interrupting the service.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Natural</h2>
<p>Access your files on any device, from anywhere at any time through a native file system interface.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Affordable</h2>
<p>No need to acquire specific hardware/appliance or setup/maintain a complicated server-side installation.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Reliable</h2>
<p>Every block of every file is dynamically replicated several times in order to ensure durability and availability of the data.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Scalable</h2>
<p>With a peer-to-peer foundation, Infinit does not suffer single points of failure or bottlenecks.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>High Performance</h2>
<p>Benefit from a high-throughput UDP-based network protocol for faster data retrieval.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Fault Tolerant</h2>
<p>Detects failures and automatically adapts the network to guarantee the reliability of the data.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>On Demand</h2>
<p>Access/stream the files on-demand without the need to store the files locally or download them before.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>Decide who can read/edit your files with fine-grain access control capabilities.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Interoperability</h2>
<p>Runs on your dearest operating system (hopefully!): MacOS X, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Versioning</h2>
<p>Browse through the different versions of a file.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Migration</h2>
<p>Easily migrate your data from one provider to another whenever you need without any service interruption.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Multi Tenant</h2>
<p>Designed from the ground up to support multiple tenants with the isolated and secure data.</p>
