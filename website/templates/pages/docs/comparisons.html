    <h1>Deploying your own personal cloud</h1>

    <p class="note">Infinit differs from most other file systems and file storage services because of its decentralized nature. The following categorizes the file systems and storage services.</p>

    <h2>Centralized File Systems</h2>

    <p>Native file systems have been developed for years. At the time, such file systems were tightly coupled to the operating system they were developed for.</p><br>

    <br><br>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system" target="_blank">Centralized file systems</a> operate by storing the data on the local hard disk, tape or whatever storage medium is provided, without relying on the network capabilities of the operating system.</p>

    <p>These file systems suffer from the unreliable nature of storing data on a single non-fault-tolerant storage medium. However, such file systems are extremely fast since accessing data that is stored locally.</p>

    <table class="centralized">
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Cost</td>
        <td>On-demand</td>
        <td>Reliable</td>
        <td>Scalable</td>
        <td>Performance</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          FAT, ext, HFS, ReiserFS, XFS, ZFS...
        </td>
        <td>easy</td>
        <td>yes</td>
        <td>no</td>
        <td>no</td>
        <td>good</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Infinit</td>
        <td>easy</td>
        <td>yes</td>
        <td>yes</td>
        <td>yes</td>
        <td>depends</td>
      </tr>
    </table><br>


    <h2>Distributed File Systems</h2>

    <p>The vast majority of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_service" target="_blank">cloud storage services</a> work the same way as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_file_system" target="_blank">distributed file systems</a>, which is by storing data on one or more servers. Clients request the data or files from those servers, making sure to maintain consistency, process popularly known as synchronization.</p><br>

    <img src="${url('images/schema-distributed.png')}" alt ="Distributed File Systems">
    <br><br>

    <p>Noteworthy is that most cloud storage services do not provide a native file system interface. Also, cloud storage services differ from more traditional distributed file systems in the way they cache data. Indeed, while a distributed file system will cache only the most recently accessed data blocks, a cloud storage service often keeps all the files in order to provide better performance, leading to a large amount of local storage capacity being consumed.</p>

    <h2>Decentralized File Systems</h2>

    <p>Other solutions were developed in opposition to cloud storage services and distributed file systems in order to overcome the limitations in terms of reliability, scalability and fault tolerance.</p><br>

    <img src="${url('images/schema-decentralized.png')}" alt ="Decentralized File Systems">
    <br><br>

    <p>By relying on the existing storage capacity left unused on most computers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing" target="_blank">decentralized file systems</a> distribute the data blocks across the network rather than storing them all in a single place i.e a server/cloud.</p>
