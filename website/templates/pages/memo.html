	  	<h2>Content Addressable</h2>
	  	<p>Each piece of information is assigned a unique identifier for self-certification, allowing for optimized data placement, fault tolerance, performance, security and integrity.</p>

	  	<h2>Decentralized</h2>
	  	<p>As opposed to the popular manager/worker (a.k.a master/slave) model, memo relies on a decentralized architecture that does away with bottlnecks, single points of failure, cascading effects etc.</p>
  	</div>

  	<div>
	  	<img src="${url('images/icons/policy-based.png')}" alt="policy based">
	  	<h2>Policy Based</h2>
	  	<p>memo can be customized through policies such as redundancy, encryption, compression, versioning, deduplication etc. so as to fit with your application's needs.</p>

	  	<p>memo's consistency model can be configured, from eventual to strong for the most demanding applications all the way to rebalancing delays and more.</p>

        <p>Scalable by nature</p>
        <p>Instead of relying on authoritative manager nodes, all the nodes play both the role of manager and worker, collectively participating in maintaining consistency, routing messages, hosting replicas and more.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="etcd">
        <p>Designed for workers to scale, not managers</p>
        <p>The manager/worker model has been designed for workers to be easily scaled out, leaving managers out of the equation and therefore limiting the overall system's scalability.</p>

    <div class="comparison">
      <div class="memo">
        <p>All the nodes can process the clients' requests</p>
        <p>Since every node can process a client's request, it is far more complicated to overflow the system, hence removing bottlenecks, single points of failure and cascading effects.</p>

        <p>The managers could get overflowed and fail</p>
        <p>The manager nodes may get overflowed by requests and fail, leading clients to redirect their requests to the remaining managers which in turn could get overflowed taking down the whole system through a cascading effect.</p>

    <div class="comparison">
      <div class="memo">
        <p>More nodes in the system means more bandwidth and power</p>
        <p>Thanks to the natural distribution of the decentralized model, the more nodes in the system, the faster requests will be processed.</p>

      <div class="memo">
        <p>Multiple per-value quorums</p>
        <p>Instead of relying on a single quorum of manager nodes for maintaing consistency, memo makes use of per-value quorums, allowing for better performance (increased parallism), fault tolerance and scalability.</p>

        <p>Consensus is achieved within the managers</p>
        <p>On top of handling clients' specific requests, orchestrating the system etc, the manager nodes are also responsible for maintaining consistency whenever a value is updated. As such, those managers have inherent limited capacity to process many of those update requests in parallel.</p>
